Warning detected by hpeesofsim in MOSFET7 during circuit set up.
    The well proximity effect is not applied as none of Sca, Scb, Scc, Sc is given and/or Sc not positive.

SP SP1[1] <MyLibrary1_lib:CS_LNA_Sparam:schematic>   freq=(500 MHz->1.2 GHz)
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    The simulation temperature (25.0 C) is not the same as the IEEE standard
    noise temperature (290 K or 16.85 C) in the noise analysis `SP1'.
    If the simulation temperature is not equal to the IEEE standard temperature,
    then the loss and the noise figure will not agree for a passive circuit.
    The `Temp' parameter on the Options item can be set to 16.85 C to
    eliminate this warning message.
