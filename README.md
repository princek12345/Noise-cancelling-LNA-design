# Noise-cancelling-LNA-design
Noise cancelling LNA design using ADS Software in UMC 65nm technology file was designed as a part of course work at IIST.

The ADS simulation file and project presentation is uploaded. 

The LNA designed at 860 MHz for LoRa band and tried to make dual band design at 433 MHz with slight change in circuits.
